# mpv-config

This is a collection of MPV configuration files, intended for high quality video rendering of traditional video (i.e. not anime).

For now, these files are tailored for rendering on Macs (e.g. current Macbooks and iMacs) that do not support Vulkan. If you have a Vulkan-enabled device, you can uncomment the relevant lines to use that graphics subsystem instead of OpenGL. 

In the future, I hope to solve for Mac's deprecated OpenGL subsystem by either supporting MoltenVK or Metal, directly.
