# mpv-config

This is a collection of MPV configuration files, intended for high quality video rendering.

These are tailored for rendering on Macs (e.g. current generation Macbooks and iMacs), which do not support Vulkan. In the future, I hope to solve for Mac's deprecated OpenGL subsystem by either supporting MoltenVK or Metal, directly.
